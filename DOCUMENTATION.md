## Overview

The scraper follows Transfermarkt's hierarchical data structure, allowing you to scrape data at any level of granularity:

```
Confederations → Competitions → Clubs → Players → Appearances
                              ↓
                            Games → Game Lineups
```

Key features:
- Modular spider architecture - scrape only what you need
- Streaming JSON Lines output format
- Supports piping between spiders for efficient workflows
- HTTP caching for development
- Season-aware scraping with automatic detection
- Parent-child relationship tracking for data lineage

## Architecture

### Data Flow Hierarchy

The scraper implements a hierarchical approach with two main data flows:

#### 1. Player Statistics Flow
```
confederations → competitions → clubs → players → appearances
```

#### 2. Match Data Flow
```
confederations → competitions → games → game_lineups
```

### Spider Types

1. **Root Spiders** (no input required)
   - `confederations`: Entry point, generates confederation URLs

2. **Hierarchy Spiders** (require parent input)
   - `competitions`: Scrapes league/competition data
   - `clubs`: Scrapes club metadata and squad rosters
   - `players`: Scrapes detailed player profiles
   - `games`: Scrapes match details and events
   - `games_urls`: Extracts game URLs without parsing details
   - `game_lineups`: Scrapes lineups and formations
   - `appearances`: Scrapes player match statistics

3. **Standalone Spiders** (optional parent input)
   - `clubs_by_url`: Direct club scraping via competition codes
   - `players_from_file`: Direct player scraping via href list
   - `games_by_url`: Direct game scraping via game hrefs/IDs

## Installation

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (install from https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd transfermarkt-scraper
poetry install
poetry shell
```

### User Agent Configuration

**Important:** This scraper requires a user agent string. Configure it in one of two ways:

1. **Via settings file** (recommended):
   Add to `tfmkt/settings.py`:
   ```python
   ROBOTSTXT_USER_AGENT = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Your User Agent)'
   ```

2. **Via command line**:
   ```bash
   scrapy crawl <spider-name> -s USER_AGENT='Mozilla/5.0 (Your User Agent)'
   ```

## Quick Start

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate confederations (root data)
scrapy crawl confederations > confederations.json

# 2. Generate competitions from confederations
scrapy crawl competitions -a parents=confederations.json > competitions.json

# 3. Generate clubs from competitions
scrapy crawl clubs -a parents=competitions.json > clubs.json

# 4. Generate players from clubs
scrapy crawl players -a parents=clubs.json > players.json

# 5. Generate appearances from players (requires season parameter)
scrapy crawl appearances -a parents=players.json -a season=2020 > appearances.json
```

### Piped Workflow (Recommended)

Process data streams without intermediate files:

```bash
# Scrape 2 competitions and their players' appearances for 2020 season
cat competitions.json | head -2 \
  | scrapy crawl clubs \
  | scrapy crawl players \
  | scrapy crawl appearances -a season=2020 > appearances_2020.json
```

### Games Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate games from competitions
scrapy crawl games -a parents=competitions.json > games.json

# 2. Generate lineups from games
scrapy crawl game_lineups -a parents=games.json > lineups.json
```

### Direct Club Scraping

Scrape specific competitions without full hierarchy:

```bash
# Scrape Champions League and Europa League clubs
scrapy crawl clubs_by_url -a codes="CL,EL" -a kind=cup -a season=2020 > ucl_clubs.json

# Scrape Premier League clubs
scrapy crawl clubs_by_url -a codes="GB1" -a kind=league -a season=2020 > epl_clubs.json

**Example:**
```bash
# Extract all games with metadata from competitions
scrapy crawl games_urls -a parents=competitions.json > all_games_metadata.json

# Filter by team and scrape details
cat all_games_metadata.json | grep "Bayern Munich" | scrapy crawl games_by_url

# Filter by date range (using jq)
cat all_games_metadata.json | jq 'select(.date_iso >= "2025-08-01" and .date_iso <= "2025-08-31")' | scrapy crawl games_by_url

# Filter only completed games
cat all_games_metadata.json | jq 'select(.result != null)' > completed_games.json

# Piped workflow with filtering
cat competitions.json | scrapy crawl games_urls | grep "Manchester" | head -10 | scrapy crawl games_by_url
```

**Performance Comparison:**
- `games` spider: ~330 requests per competition (1 for fixtures + ~329 for individual games)
- `games_urls` spider: 1 request per competition (fixtures page only)
- Result: 300x faster with rich metadata included

- Match results and scores (full-time and half-time)
- Match metadata (date, time, stadium, attendance)
- Referee and manager information
- Player lineups (starting XI and substitutes for both teams)
- All match events (goals, cards, substitutions, shootouts)

**Use Case:**
- Refresh specific game data without re-scraping entire competitions
- Target high-profile matches or specific matchdays
- Update recent games from a known list of game IDs
- Process curated game lists from external sources

**Example:**
```bash
# From file with selected games
scrapy crawl games_by_url -a parents=selected_games.json > game_details.json

# From stdin (cherry-picking)
cat all_games.json | grep "3426901\|3426916" | scrapy crawl games_by_url

### Input/Output Matrix

| Spider | Input Type | Input Source | Output Type | Output Feeds To |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| confederations | None | - | confederation | competitions |
| competitions | confederation | confederations | competition | clubs, games, games_urls |
| clubs | competition | competitions | club (with players[]) | players |
| clubs_by_url | codes/hrefs | Command line | club (with players[]) | players |
| players | club | clubs, clubs_by_url | player | appearances |
| players_from_file | player href | File/stdin | player | appearances |
| games | competition | competitions | game (full) | game_lineups |
| games_urls | competition | competitions | game (URL only) | games_by_url |
| games_by_url | game href | File/stdin, games_urls | game (full) | game_lineups |
| game_lineups | game | games, games_by_url | game_lineups | - |
| appearances | player | players, players_from_file | appearance | - |

### Parent-Child Relationships

Each spider (except root spiders) embeds its parent object in the output for traceability:

```json
{
  "type": "club",
  "name": "Manchester City",
  "parent": {
    "type": "competition",
    "competition_code": "GB1",
    "country_name": "England"
  },
  "players": [...]
}
```

This enables:
- Data lineage tracking
- Filtering and grouping in downstream processing
- Understanding context of scraped data

### Deduplication Strategy

Different spiders implement deduplication at various levels:

1. **Competitions Spider**: Deduplicates by `country_id + competition_code`
2. **Clubs Spider**: Deduplicates players within squad by `player_id`
3. **Other Spiders**: No automatic deduplication (assumes unique parent inputs)

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Incremental Updates

Update only specific entities without re-scraping entire hierarchy:

```bash
# Update specific clubs
echo '{"type": "competition", "href": "/premier-league/startseite/wettbewerb/GB1"}' \
  | scrapy crawl clubs -a season=2021 > clubs_updated.json

# Update specific players
jq -r 'select(.name == "Cristiano Ronaldo") | {type: "player", href: .href}' players.json \
  | scrapy crawl players_from_file > ronaldo_updated.json
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Scraping

Scrape multiple competitions in parallel:

```bash
# Split competitions into batches
split -l 10 competitions.json comp_batch_

# Process in parallel (GNU parallel required)
parallel -j 4 'cat {} | scrapy crawl clubs > clubs_{#}.json' ::: comp_batch_*
```

### Pattern 3: Filtered Scraping

Use jq to filter input before piping to next spider:

```bash
# Scrape only first-tier competitions
jq 'select(.competition_type == "first_tier")' competitions.json \
  | scrapy crawl clubs > top_tier_clubs.json

# Scrape only clubs with high market value
jq 'select(.total_market_value | contains("bn"))' clubs.json \
  | scrapy crawl players > top_clubs_players.json
```

### Pattern 4: Multi-Season Scraping

Scrape same entities across multiple seasons:

```bash
# Scrape clubs for multiple seasons
for season in 2018 2019 2020 2021; do
  scrapy crawl clubs -a parents=competitions.json -a season=$season > clubs_$season.json
done
```

### Pattern 5: Data Enrichment

Combine data from multiple sources:

```bash
# Get clubs with games and lineups
scrapy crawl clubs -a parents=competitions.json > clubs.json

echo '{"type": "competition", "href": "/premier-league/startseite/wettbewerb/GB1"}' \
  | scrapy crawl games > games.json

scrapy crawl game_lineups -a parents=games.json > lineups.json

# Now you can join clubs.json with lineups.json using player hrefs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Spider fails with "No user agent"
```
Solution: Set USER_AGENT in settings.py or via command line
scrapy crawl spider -s USER_AGENT='Mozilla/5.0 ...'
```

**Issue**: No output produced
```
Solution: Check LOG_LEVEL setting, increase to INFO or DEBUG
scrapy crawl spider -s LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**Issue**: HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
```
Solution: Reduce concurrent requests and add delays
scrapy crawl spider -s CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=1 -s DOWNLOAD_DELAY=2
```

**Issue**: Scraper extracts outdated data
```
Solution: Clear HTTP cache
rm -rf .scrapy/httpcache/
```

**Issue**: Parent file not found
```
Solution: Use absolute path or check file exists
scrapy crawl clubs -a parents=$(pwd)/competitions.json
```

**Issue**: Season not found
```
Solution: Check available seasons on Transfermarkt, some older seasons may not be available
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable verbose logging:**
   ```bash
   scrapy crawl spider -s LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
   ```

2. **Test with small samples:**
   ```bash
   cat competitions.json | head -1 | scrapy crawl clubs
   ```

3. **Inspect HTTP cache:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh .scrapy/httpcache/tfmkt/
   ```

4. **Use scrapy shell for interactive debugging:**
   ```bash
   scrapy shell "https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/..."
   ```

5. **Validate output format:**
   ```bash
   scrapy crawl spider | jq empty
   # If jq returns error, JSON is malformed
   ```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

HTTP caching is enabled by default for development. For production:

```python
# Disable cache for fresh data
HTTPCACHE_ENABLED = False

# Or use cache with expiration
HTTPCACHE_EXPIRATION_SECS = 86400  # 24 hours
```

### Concurrency Settings

Adjust based on your needs and respect for the target site:

```python
# In settings.py or via command line
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 8  # Default: 16
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN = 4  # Default: 8
DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 1  # Seconds between requests
```

### Memory Management

For large scrapes, use streaming output:

```bash
# Stream directly to gzipped file
scrapy crawl clubs | gzip > clubs.json.gz

# Process in chunks
scrapy crawl clubs | split -l 1000 - club_chunk_
```

## Data Quality and Validation

### Missing Data Handling

Spiders handle missing data gracefully:
- Optional fields return `null` or empty strings
- Missing parent relationships are logged but don't fail the spider
- Deduplication prevents duplicate entries

### Data Validation

Validate scraped data:

```bash
# Check for required fields
jq 'select(.type and .href)' output.json

# Count items by type
jq -r '.type' output.json | sort | uniq -c

# Find items missing specific fields
jq 'select(.market_value == null or .market_value == "")' players.json
```

### Data Completeness

Check scraping completeness:

```bash
# Count expected vs actual
echo "Expected clubs: $(jq -r '.total_clubs' competitions.json | paste -sd+ | bc)"
echo "Scraped clubs: $(wc -l < clubs.json)"

# Check for errors in logs
scrapy crawl clubs 2>&1 | grep -i error
```

4. **Test changes:**
   ```bash
   # Test with sample data
   scrapy crawl your_spider -a parents=samples/sample.json

   # Run scrapy contracts
   scrapy check your_spider
   ```

5. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: ..."
   git push origin feature/my-enhancement

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to spider classes
- Comment complex XPath/CSS selectors

### Testing

Add scrapy contracts to your spiders:

```python
class MySpider(CommonSpider):
    """
    @url http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/...
    @returns items 1
    @scrapes type href name
    """
    # Spider implementation
```

Run contracts:
```bash
scrapy check my_spider
```
